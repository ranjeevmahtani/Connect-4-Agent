# Connect-4-Agent
My end-of-course project for Udacity's Intro to Java course. An automated connect 4 player that on each turn seeks immediate horizontal, vertical, and diagonal winning opportunities for itself, and seeks to block the same for it's opponent. When none of those are present, it plays a random move.
